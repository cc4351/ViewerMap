# A Twitch Extension

This twitch extension is created to let user to input their region and comments and determine the language of the comment as well as the region the viewers are from. All information will be actively entered by the user with their consents. The converted language and region information would then be projected to a google map for both the viewers and the streamers to see viewer distribution. This could potentially make the users feel more connected within the viewership and give the streamer more information on the viewer and therefore be more successful at streaming.
